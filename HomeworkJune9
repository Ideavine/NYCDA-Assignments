=begin
Create a program to analyze a large block of text and report back on the frequency of each word in the text.
a.Start by sorting the text into a hash where each word is a key with the word’s value being the amount of 
times it has been used in the block:{the: 10, john: 1, of: 15}b.Once you’ve created this hash, return the word 
that has been used the mostc.When you’re done, encapsulate your script inside of a method that can analyze any 
block of text fed to it

#no idea if this is close?
