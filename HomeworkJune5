I am trying to combine cities with the corresponding country using the .merge. I also tried .join and .each. No luck.
Cities = {"Rio", "Accra", "Joburg", "Moscow"}
Countries = {":Brazil", ":Ghana", ":SouthAfrica:", ":Russia"}
Cities.merge(Countries)
end

        puts "Buzz"
      elsif i % 3 == 0

HOMEWORK
1. Create the following functions:
a.Create a function that takes a string and adds the phrase “Only in America!” to the end of it
b.Create a function to find the maximum value in an array of numbers. 
For instance:[100,10,-1000]should return 100.
c.Create a function that takes two arguments - both of them arrays. 
Inside of the function, combine the arrays using the items from the first array as keys and the second array as 
values. 
For example, when these two arrays are supplied as arguments:[:toyota, :tesla][“Prius”, “Model S”]
they should return a hash like so:{toyota: “Prius”, tesla: “Model S”}
2.Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the 
number and for multiples of five print “Buzz”. Print “FizzBuzz” for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.
